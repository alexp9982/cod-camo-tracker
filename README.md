# Call of Duty Camo Tracker

## The ultimate camo tracker

Call of Duty Camo Tracker is a Call of Duty camouflage tracker to easily manage your progress towards the *DM Ultra* , *Dark Aether* , and *Damascus* camouflages. This is one of my first sites, with heavy inspiration by whom I have mentioned in the credits section of the site.

Built using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), hosted by [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

## Features

- Auto-Saved – Progress is automatically saved and stored locally on your computer.
- Responsive & Fast – Use it on your computer or smartphone with ease.
- Export/Import – Export your progress to another device or browser.
- Ad-free – None of that obnoxious stuff
